Idea for 6.1:

Create a matrix -> find guard position -> create a direction variable (only 4 options) ->
check whether there is an obstacle to next step -> if there is one, change the direction ->
repeat till end

**Optimize in accordance with part 2!!!**

Idea for 6.2:

Find guard position -> get guard path -> make an obstacle for each coordinate in path -> 
check whether there is a loop - coordinate encounters twice -> if so append a counter
